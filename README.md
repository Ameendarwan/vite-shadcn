### Development

To start the project in `development` mode, run `npm run dev`.

The project runs on port `3000` by default, but this can be changed in `./vite.config.ts`.

### Building

To build the project in `prodction` mode `npm run build`.

### Commit with Husky

Husky is used to enforce pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before commits. Follow these steps to commit:

- Make your changes to the codebase.
- Stage the changes with git add ..
- Run git commit -m "Your commit message".
- Husky will trigger and run lint-staged to check for formatting issues and linting errors.
- If all checks pass, the commit will be completed.
- If any checks fail, Husky will prevent the commit and show you the issues to fix.

### IDE Configuration

The suggested IDE for this project is VSCode.

Install these extension for code-completion and linting in the IDE:

- **ESLint** (by Microsoft) to enforce **Code Quality Rules**
- **Prettier** (by Prettier) to enforce **JS/TS Formatting Rules**
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** (by Tailwind) for **CSS tooling**
